/*
 * Problem 5.6
 * Assume: In MTX, P1 is a Casanova process, which hops, not from bed to bed,
 * but from segment to segment, Initially, P1 runs in the segment 0x2000.
 * By a hop(u16 segment) syscall, it enters kernel to change segment. When it
 * returns to Umode, it returns to an identical Umode image but in a different
 * segment, e.g. 0x4000. Devise an algorithm for the hop() syscall, and implment
 * it in MTX to satisfy the lusts of Casnova process.
